# TSP-using-Ant-Colony-Algorithm
The **traveling salesman problem (TSP)** asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?"
It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research.

the **ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO)** is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding good paths through graphs. Artificial ants stand for multi-agent methods inspired by the behavior of real ants. The pheromone-based communication of biological ants is often the predominant paradigm used. Combinations of artificial ants and local search algorithms have become a method of choice for numerous optimization tasks involving some sort of graph, e.g., vehicle routing and internet routing.
